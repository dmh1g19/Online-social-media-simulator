# Network Simulation for Information Diffusion

## Overview

This project is a simulation of information spread within a social media network, focusing on the dynamics of message sharing and the impact of inauthentic accounts, known as "bad actors," on the dissemination of content. It models user interactions based on their interests, represented as topics, and the authenticity of their profiles.

## Purpose

The purpose of this simulation is to study how different factors, including topic bias and the presence of inauthentic accounts, affect the quality and engagement of information shared in a network. The project is inspired by the findings of the paper "Vulnerabilities of the Online Public Square to Manipulation," which discusses strategies for adversarial manipulation in social media and measures to counteract such efforts.

## Key Aspects

- **Topic Bias Simulation**: Nodes have assigned topics that influence their behavior in sharing content.
- **Inauthentic Account Modeling**: Certain nodes are designated as "inauthentic" to mimic malicious accounts.
- **Engagement and Quality Metrics**: Each message has associated engagement and quality scores, impacting its spread.
- **Machine Learning Dataset Generation**: The simulation generates a dataset capturing the network's dynamics for ML applications.

## Installation
